# Wordle: Guess the Hidden Word
The rules are very simple: You have to guess the hidden word (from 5 letters) in 6 tries. To get started, just type any word on the first line. If the letter is guessed correctly and is in the correct place, it will be highlighted in green, if the letter is in the word, but in the wrong place - in yellow, and if the letter is not in the word, it will remain pink.
## Different Languages
There is a choice of two languages: **English** and **Russian**.
